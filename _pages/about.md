Hi, I'm Alfredo. I am a PhD student at the Carnegie Mellon University Language Technologies Institute. I am co-advised by [Mona Diab](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/people/faculty/diab-mona.html) and [Fernando Diaz](https://841.io/) and supported by a [National Science Foundation CSGrad4US fellowship](https://cra.org/csgrad4us/).
